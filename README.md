COL-215 Course Offered By IIT-Delhi in the first semester of the academic year 2024-25.

A1: (in VHDL)
An implementation of the 2x1 Multiplexer (Mux) i.e. d1.sâ€™ + d2.s and
An implementation of the 4x1 Multiplexer (Mux) using three 2x1 Multiplexers.
Output: s0'.s1'.i0 + s0.s1'.i1 + s0'.s1.i2 + s0.s1.i3 

A2:
Gate Packing (in Python): Written a program to assign locations to all gates in a plane so that: 
1. no two gates are overlapping 
2. Minimise the bounding box of the entire circuit (smallest rectangle that encloses all gates).
This is an open problem, where I implemented First-Fit Decreasing Height (FFDH) algorithm: https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~epa/surveyhtml.html#bib.9

A3:
Timing Optimisation in Gate Positioning (in Python): expanded upon A2 to accommodate pin connections and minimise critical path.

A4: (In VHDL)
Implemented Seven segment decoder for 1 and all 4 LED displays,to display a 4-bit number on a 7-segment display on FPGA.

A5: (In VHDL)
AES decryption operation for 128 bits and 256 bits: Implemented Finite State Machine to integrate Compute unit: Galois Field Multiplication for Inverse Mixed Columns, Inverse Shift Rows, Inverse SubBytes and Display Unit on FPGA after conversion to ASCII, control unit and memory block.
Also implemented RAM/ROM block to read from and write to a given .coe file.
